# Django Essential Training - Repository Copy

This repository is a copy of the LinkedIn Learning course "Django Essential Training" by instructor Leticia Portella. The full course is available on LinkedIn Learning.

## Course Description

Django is a robust and powerful framework with many moving parts. Starting a new project with Django can be straightforward, but there's much to explore. The course covers fundamental concepts such as what a framework is, what an HTTP request is, and how Django responds to HTTP requests. Instructor Leticia Portella guides you through the process of building a functional system that can create, edit, and list books per user, complete with an authentication system. Topics include getting started, creating users and data, working with ORMs, creating dynamic templates, Django class-based views, and more.
